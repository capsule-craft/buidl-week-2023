This repo was created for Eth Denver BUIDL Week 2023!
It's a follow along workshop that introduces you to the Move programming language and Sui.

### Requirements:

- yarn (a Typescript package manager)
- A code-editor (VSCode works)

### Optional:

- The Sui CLI; you only need this if you want to deploy your own modules to devnet! Everything else we do will be in the client.

Unfortunately devnet gets wiped every Wednesday, so these package-ids may no longer exist at the time of you reading this. That's okay! All you need to do is deploy them again, and switch the package-ids from the old ids listed here to the new deployed ids.

The example packages were taken from the Sui-core repository, not authored by me.
